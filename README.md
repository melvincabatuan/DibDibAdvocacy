# Dibdib Advocacy 

Dibdib Advocacy App (v2.0) is a Breast Cancer awareness application for spreading awareness and helping Filipino women fight against breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. Philippines is among the countries with highest trends in incidence of the disease. Majority of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where most women are diagnosed in late stages, due mainly to lack of awareness on early detection, and barriers to health services. This app includes basic facts, risk factors, inspection guide, palpation video, integrated with Google Maps, Android's Text-to-Speech API and Image processing, providing a fully integrated app experience. 

This app is developed and maintained by the Intelligent Systems Laboratory of De La Salle University-Manila under the Philippine Commission of Higher Education (CHED)- Philippine Research Network (PHERNET) Sustainability Studies Program.
