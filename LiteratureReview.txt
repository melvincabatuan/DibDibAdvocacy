### mHealth

The term mHealth was coined by Robert Istepanian as use of "emerging mobile communications and network technologies for healthcare".

A definition used at the 2010 mHealth Summit of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) was "the delivery of healthcare services via mobile communication devices".

### Design, implementation and validation of a novel open framework for agile development of mobile health applications, Oresti Banos, Claudia Villalonga, Rafael Garcia, Alejandro Saez, Miguel Damas, Juan A Holgado-Terriza, Sungyong Lee, Hector Pomares, Ignacio Rojas, 2nd International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering (IWBBIO 2014) Grenada, Spain. 7-9 April 2014

- Goal:

This work presents mHealthDroid, an open source Android implementation of a mHealth (mobile health) Framework designed to facilitate the rapid and easy development of mHealth and biomedical apps.

The mHealth framework is particularly planned to leverage the potential of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, wearable sensors and portable biomedical systems.

- The framework implements several functionalities to support resource and communication abstraction, biomedical data acquisition, health knowledge extraction, persistent data storage, adaptive visualization, system management and value-added services such as intelligent alerts, recommendations and guidelines.

An exemplary application is also presented along this work to demonstrate the potential of mHealthDroid. This app is used to investigate on the analysis of human behavior, which is considered to be one of the most prominent areas in mHealth. 

An accurate activity recognition model is developed and successfully validated in both offline and online conditions.

Mainstream applications in the medical domain are principally devoted to learning and informative purposes. Examples of these apps are

- Research Gap

" Despite the effort put on the development of health frameworks and tools, past contributions either focus on a specific domain or lack some essential features of health applications."

- mHealth objectives 

1) to allow developers to rapidly build applications while integrating a wide spectrum of mobile health devices; 

2) to grant simple access, representation and processing of health data collected through heterogeneous resources across several applications.

- Requirements

1) A certain level of abstraction from heterogeneous resources should be ensured to make hardware and its communication transparent to the developer.

2) For the sake of interoperability, the framework should also define a unified model for multimodal health data.

3) Medical and health applications can operate on a local basis or remotely, thus it should be supported both local and remote storage of health data.

4) Raw medical and physiological data is normally analyzed to extract health knowledge. Accordingly, a mHealth framework should include signal processing, data mining and machine learning techniques tailored to mHealth applications.

5) Mechanisms to visualize medical and health information in a user-friendly fashion must be also provided for both average users and specialists.

6) It should have provision of healthcare services such as health delivery, personalized guidelines and intelligent recommendations.

7) The framework should be modular and extensible to future sensor technologies and application needs.


- What are they proposing?

A novel framework devised to enable the easy and agile development of mHealth applications leveraging on heterogeneous wearable biomedical devices is proposed.

- Summary

mHealth data delivered by mobile and biomedical sensors is collected and structured by the Communication Manager.

This raw data can be stored in the Storage Manager, further processed by the Data Processing Manager, graphically represented by the Visualization Manager or directly used by the applications built on the mHeath Framework.

The medical knowledge derived by the Data Processing Manager can also be stored in the Storage Manager, input to advanced functionalities provided by the Service Enablers or used by the mHealth applications.

Since the Storage Manager offers persistence, stored data can be offline processed by the Data Processing Manager, graphically represented by the Visualization Manager or accessed by the mHealth applications.

The mHealth Framework offers, by means of the System Manager, functionalities to manage general resources of the mobile or wearable device.

### Development of Smartphone Educational Application for Patients with Coronary Artery Disease, Min Jung Cho, Jae Lan Sim, Seon Young Hwang, Healthc Inform Res. 2014 April;20(2):117-124.


- Goal:

This study was conducted to develop a smartphone application (app) as an educational learning instrument for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and to assess the users’ level of satisfaction.

- Methods:

This methodological research involves elicited learning content for CAD patients to develop a learning instrument using the smartphone app. The app was developed according to the steps of Assessment, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation, which is a systematic instructional design model. The levels of satisfaction with the developed smartphone app among 30 outpatients with CAD were assessed via a questionnaire during their visits to a cardiology outpatient department.

- Results:

A smartphone app ‘Strong Heart’ was developed through reviewing the literature associated with education for CAD patients under professional supervision and searching for medical smartphone apps that are already available. The learning contents include six main sections containing essential learning issues in managing CAD and additional information to attract the user’s attention, such as patient cases and quizzes. After modification with feedback from experts, the app was finally developed and evaluated by patients who reported that they were satisfied with the usefulness of the app.

- Conclusions

The developed smartphone app is available on both the iPhone App Store and the Android Play Store. Patients with CAD may utilize the app for supporting educational material without limitations of time and space.

### A better regulation is required in viral hepatitis smartphone applications, M. R. Cantudo-Cuenca, M. A. Robustillo-Cortés, M. D. Cantudo-Cuenca y R. Morillo-Verdugo, Farm Hosp. 2014;38(2):112-117

- Goal: 

To describe the characteristics and content of the available viral hepatitis mobile applications, as well as assess the level of participation of medical professionals in their development.

- Results: 

A total of 33 apps were included (from 232 that were identified), among which there were 10 duplicates. Most of these apps were uploaded under the medical category. Three had ratings less than 3.9 stars (out of 5). Only 6 apps had exceeded 1000 downloads. A total of 12 apps were aimed at health professionals, while 4 focused on patients (7 for both of them). The participation of health professionals in the development of apps was 56.6%.

- Conclusions: 

Viral hepatitis apps are available for both professionals and patients; however, much of the information contained within them is often not validated. They should be certificated.

- Comments:

"Useful for existing Apps review; certification of the App content from qualified professionals; Health App regulation." -MKC

### CHIPS: Content-based Heuristics for Improving Photo Privacy for Smartphones, Jiaqi Tan, et al.

We propose CHIPS, a unique content-based fine-grained run-time access control system for stored photos for Android which requires minimal user assistance, runs entirely locally, and provides low-level enforcement. 

CHIPS can recognize faces with minimal user training to deny apps access to photos with known faces. 

CHIPS's privacy identification has low overheads as privacy checks are cached, and is accurate, with false-positive and false-negative rates of less than 8%.

Android is based on Linux, and it uses Linux file owners and permissions to control access to files. 

Android provides per-app isolation for data files belonging to different apps. However, this per-app file isolation does not apply to stored photo files, as photos are stored in the external storage location, /sdcard. 

All files in the external storage location of an Android device are owned by the system user and sdcard_rw group, and they are group-readable and group-writable by default.


An Android app can access stored photos in a number of ways. 

(i) An app can list the files in the system-wide photo directory and open the file storing the photo. 

(ii) An app can use the Android MediaStore API to retrieve a list of available photos and their metadata (e.g. full path, thumbnails). Then, the app can open the file for the photo at its given path. 

(iii) An app can delegate photo selection to the system by using the Android framework's \Image Picker" interface (in the com.android.gallery3d package), and the framework returns an internal URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Then, the app can use the framework's ContentResolver object to obtain an Java InputStream to read the photo, and the framework opens the file containing the requested photo on behalf of the app.



Based on their requested permissions, 73% of the top 250 free apps on the Google Play store have unexpected and complete access to the photos stored on a user's smartphone, and can even exfiltrate these photos (further analysis is needed to determine if these apps actually exfiltrate photos without the user's knowledge).


Nonetheless, these apps can still access all stored photos, regardless of which photos users picked. Thus, there is a need for stronger, finer-grained access control for stored photos.

### Mobile Image Analysis: Android vs. iOS, Claudiu Cobarzan, Marco A. Hudelist, Klaus Schoemann, Manfred Jurgen Primus

Currently, computer vision applications are becoming more common on mobile devices due to the constant increase in raw processing power coupled with extended battery life. 

The OpenCV framework is a popular choice when developing such applications on desktop computers as well as on mobile devices, but there are few comparative performance studies available. 

We know of only one such study that evaluates a set of typical OpenCV operations on iOS devices. In this paper we look at the same operations, spanning from simple image manipulation like grayscalin and blurring to keypoint detection and descriptor extraction but on flagship Android devices as well as on iOS devices and with different image resolutions. 

We compare the results of the same tests running on the two platforms on the same datasets and provide extended measurements on completion time and battery usage.


Phase 1: typical computer vision operations: grayscaling, image blurring using
Gaussian blur, face and edge detection;

Phase 2: keypoint detection and descriptor extraction operations using SIFT [9]
and SURF [2].


In this paper we showed results for performance measurements of common OpenCV functions executed on Android and iOS mobile devices. 

Our measurements were grouped into common operations, keypoint detection and descriptor extraction. 

The obtained results show that most modern mobile devices can achieve good and in some cases excellent results for the considered operations, meaning that powerful computer vision applications will be possible on such devices in the near future. 

Overall, better performance was achieved with Android devices.!!!!!!!!




### Smartphone applications for melanoma detection by community, patient and generalist clinician users: a review

What’s already known about this topic?

• Earlier detection of melanoma would allow timely treatment and could improve outcomes.

• Although smartphone applications (‘apps’) are recognized as having potentially wide use in dermatology and oncology, experts have expressed caution concerning their diagnostic utility and safety.


What does this study add?

• We identified almost 40 smartphone apps available to detect or prevent melanoma by nonspecialist users including previously unaffected individuals, patients previously diagnosed with skin cancer, and generalist clinicians.

• Most apps gave advice or education about melanoma, ultraviolet radiation exposure preventive advice, and skin self-examination strategies; half of the apps enabled patients to capture and store images of their skin lesions either for review by a dermatologist or for self-monitoring to identify change, an important predictor of melanoma; only four apps provided a risk assessment about a skin lesion.

• There was little evidence of clinical or research-based input into the design of these apps or of evaluation of their utility, so clinicians should be cautious about supporting the use of such apps to detect melanoma.

### mHealth in Urology: A Review of Experts’ Involvement in App Development, Nuno Pereira-Azevedo et al.

Conclusions

Despite the increasing Mobile Health (mHealth) market, this is the first study that demonstrates the lack of expert participation in the design of Urology apps, particularly in apps designed for the general public. 

Until clear regulation is enforced, the urological community should help regulate app development. 

Maintaining a register of certified apps or issuing an official scientific seal of approval could improve overall app quality. We propose that urologists become stakeholders in mHealth, shaping future app design and promoting peer-review app validation.




### Not Just a Tool. Taking Context into Account in the Development of a Mobile App for Rural Water Supply in Tanzania


The 'eGovernance' hype around the potential of mobile phone and geoweb technologies for enhancing 'good governance' is soaring.

From our experiences we therefore conclude that public crowdsourcing in the context of empowerment and accountability regarding public services is not a viable approach in Tanzania at the present time. One way to understand how this proposition could gain such popularity is to compare the purpose of the webApps and mApps discussed so far. 

Many ICT innovations, whether web- or mobile-based, have a communication model where the applications facilitate trade between producers and consumers in a market, e.g. like Amazon or eBay: these are 'commercial Apps'. Alternatively, the applications could facilitate communications in civil society settings such as Facebook and WhatsApp: these are 'social Apps'. Wikipedia and Open Street map are examples of participatory knowledge gathering, or 'knowledge Apps', that use crowdsourcing and are the inspiration of many of the Apps mentioned above, like Maji Matone, Text to Change, Ushahidi, and the Zanzibar HSW. 

However, the latter have governance goals which make them 'political Apps' and therefore likely to raise more controversy and resistance. Using a very simple conveyor belt model of the political process, at least six different models can be defined in which digital technologies have possible impact on democratic governance (Fung et al., 2013). 

On the basis of well-known institutional constraints and normal political incentives, the authors argue that only three of these, truth-based advocacy, constituent mobilisation, and crowdsourced monitoring, have a chance to be successful. In each of these three, incumbent intermediaries, notably political parties, vested interest groups and NGOs, use digital technologies to boost the effectiveness of their present roles in the existing governance system, as opposed to challenging the system. This means that digital technology piggy-backs on and may increases the power of existing political actors.

We find that we cannot escape power relations and politics if we want software that works, no matter how cleverly we include context models – or maybe because we include context models! We cannot avoid going with the grain (Kelsall, 2008) in our efforts to respect the context:

The way to understand the effect of technology on politics is not to generalize or analogize from one or other digital platform – such as the collaborative production of knowledge on Wikipedia – but rather to understand some digital technology as a part and an intervention in a larger political system (Fung et al., 2013).



"Apps can fail especially in the political domain where complex power play is involved." -MKC

*** Superior quality mobile applications can be developed with the help of process oriented
methods. ****

To obtain prosperity in the current mobile world, merely developing an app is not just enough.

Thus, the goal of the developer is to keep an open mind and embrace innovative procedures that can avail amend the life cycle (gathering requirements, design, development, testing, and maintenance) of an app while enhancing user satisfaction. 

New technologies are emerging every day, and hence developers should always be well apprised about current trends, requirements, and events in the mobile technology field. There will always be incipient avenues that will arise in the future for developing new and innovative apps.

### Algorithms for Smartphone and Tablet Image Analysis for Healthcare Applications, PAUL J. F. WHITE(Student Member, IEEE), BLAKE W. PODAIMA(Member, IEEE), AND MARCIA R. FRIESEN

- Goal

This paper developed image analysis algorithms that facilitate noncontact measurements of irregularly shaped images (e.g., wounds), where the image is take with a sole smartphone or tablet camera. The image analysis relies on the sensors integrated in the smartphone or tablet with no auxiliary or add-on instrumentation on the device. Three approaches to image analysis were developed and evaluated: 

1) computing depth using autofocus data; 
2) a custom sensor fusion of inertial sensors and feature tracking in a video stream; and 
3) a custom pinch/zoom approach. ***

### Apps Seeking Theories: Results of a Study on the Use of Health Behavior Change Theories in Cancer Survivorship Mobile Apps, Deborah Vollmer Dahlke et al.

- Goal

This study is designed to assess the presence of and manner in which health behavior change and health communication theories are applied in mobile phone cancer survivorship apps.

- Conclusions

Mobile apps are rapidly emerging as a way to deliver health behavior change interventions that can be tailored or personalized for individuals. As these apps and games continue to evolve and include interactive and adaptive sensors and other forms of dynamic feedback, their content and interventional elements need to be grounded in human computer interface design and health behavior and communication theory and practice.

### A Manual Categorization of Android App Development Issues on Stack Overflow, Stefanie Beyer and Martin Pinzger, 2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution


- Goal

To present a manual categorization of 450 Android related posts of Stack Overflow concerning their question and problem types. The idea is to find dependencies between certain problems and question types to get better insights into issues of Android App development.

- Result

Analyzing the questions and problems we found that developers mainly have problems with the usage of API components, such as User Interface and Core Elements. 

Developers also ask if the realization of their ideas is possible with Libs/APIs and User Interface components. 

Errors are often mentioned in questions related to Network, Database, and Fragments.




### Evaluating and Designing Smartphone Applications for Nursing Education, Junqing Zhan, International Conference on Computer, Communications and Information Technology

The use of smartphone applications would be the good supplement for nursing education. 

The smartphone provides an efficient and user-friendly access to references and learning materials.

App users should closely cooperate with the developers in the system design and software testing to produce an efficient and user-friendly smartphone app for nursing education.


### Screenmilker: How to Milk Your Android Screen for Secrets (Android Security Problems), Chia-Chi Lin, Hongyang Li, Xiaoyong Zhou, XiaoFeng Wang


We found that all such apps (with ADB-level capabilities) in the market inadvertently expose this ADB capability to any party with the INTERNET permission on the same device. With this exposure, a malicious app can be built to stealthily and intelligently collect sensitive user data through screenshots. 

To understand the threat, we built Screenmilker, an app that can detect the right moment to monitor the screen and pick up a user’s password when she is typing in real time. We show that this can be done efficiently by leveraging the unique design of smartphone user interfaces and its public resources. 

Such an understanding also informs Android developers how to protect this screenshot capability, should they consider providing an interface to let third-party developers use it in the future, and more generally the security risks of the ADB workaround, a standard technique gaining popularity in app development. 

Based on the understanding, we present a mitigation mechanism that controls the exposure of the ADB capabilities only to authorized apps.

### Using Cognitive Load Theory to select an Environment for Teaching Mobile Apps Development, Raina Mason et al.

- Goal

In this paper we have addressed the usability criterion for selecting an environment for teaching programming to relative novices. We have introduced a method for evaluating and comparing usability among a selection of candidate products, and have applied this method to the selection of a programming environment for teaching the development of apps for mobile devices.

TouchDevelop and LiveCode, with threshold scores of less than 20%, permitted the development of code with the least relative cognitive load.

Despite the fact that it was designed for, and is typically used for, novice programmers, App Inventor had double the threshold score of these two environments, indicating a substantially higher relative cognitive load. 

Both Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio had threshold scores of around 60%, nearly double again, indicating another substantial leap in the relative cognitive load required to develop mobile apps in these environments.
 


### Helping Children Eat Well Via Mobile Software Technologies, Violetta Vylegzhanina, Douglas C. Schmidt, Pamela Hull, Janice S. Emerson, Meghan E. Quirk, and Shelagh Mulvaney

- Goal

This paper describes an Android mobile app we developed to simplify the shopping experience of participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides low-income families vouchers to purchase life-stage appropriate, nutritious foods.

This paper explains the key domain and technical challenges we faced when creating our Android app and describes how we overcame these challenges by applying data normalization, software patterns, and Agile development methods.

- Problems

A key goal of the CHEW project is to collect and evaluate participants’ shopping data to access the impact of nutrition education provided through the app and make necessary adjustments to the program. We therefore needed a solution that would allow efficient data analytics to aid nutrition studies.

Solution. 

To implement this solution, we employed Open mHealth [5],

### cODA: An Open-Source Framework to Easily Design Context-Aware Android Apps, M. Ferroni, A. Damiani, A. A. Nacci, D. Sciuto, M. D. Santambrogio, 

- Goal

The proposed methodology aims at providing the guideline to develop context aware applications on the selected family of mobile devices, exploiting the features of the selected platforms. 

An asynchronous communication pattern among the Observe-Decide-Act loop components, on which the context aware applications are based, is presented by means of Android Broadcast Receivers and Android Intent.

We propose a framework to support the development of context aware applications for Android devices: the goal of such applications is to reduce as much as possible the interaction with the user, making use of automatic and intelligent components.

The cODA framework is open source and can be downloaded from https://github.com/mattferroni/cODA





### Development and validation of an appbased cell counter for use in the clinical laboratory setting, Alexander C. Thurman, Jessica L. Davis, Max Jan, Charles E. McCulloch, and Benjamin D. Buelow

- Goal

Appbased counters have not been widely adopted by clinical laboratories, perhaps owing to a presumed decrease in count accuracy related to the lack of tactile feedback inherent in a touchscreen interface. We herein provide the first systematic evidence that digital cell counters function similarly to standard tabletop units.

Result:

Our analysis suggests that no systematic differences exist between cellular differentials obtained via appbased or tabletop counters and that agreement between these two methods is excellent.

In summary, we have presented here the first statistical evidence that digital/appbased
cell counters are functionally similar to analog tabletop devices in the generation of manual cellular differentials.

There are three categories of mobile application namely native, web based and hybrid. For mobile learning system, hybrid is an appropriate choice. In order to avoid re-implementation of the same hybrid application for different platform separately, several tools are proposed for example: PhoneGap, Adobe Air, Sencha Touch and QT, each with their own strength. 

With proper use of the strength of individual framework or the combination of frameworks, more compatible and more stable, cross-platform mobile learning application specifically for quizzes and assignments can be developed.

### FoodSwitch: A Mobile Phone App to Enable Consumers to Make Healthier Food Choices and Crowdsourcing of National Food Composition Data, Elizabeth Dunford, et al.

- Goal

We sought to develop a mobile phone app that would provide consumers with easy to understand nutrition information and support the selection of healthier choices when shopping for food.

- Conclusion

FoodSwitch has empowered Australian consumers seeking to make better food choices. In parallel, the huge volume of crowdsourced data has provided a novel means for lowcost, realtime tracking of the nutritional composition of Australian foods. There appears to be significant opportunity for this approach in many other countries.

FoodSwitch has greatly exceeded our expectations both in regard to numbers of downloads and the crowdsourcing of data. Based on this success and the clear potential for scalability, there are a series of further upgrades planned and we hope to launch the app with partners in multiple developed and developing countries around the world. The proposed model is one whereby the local partner organization takes leadership of the project in their country with the Australia-based team providing technical support and advice about how to achieve launch and the requirements for postlaunch support. We hope that local partners will also take the lead in using the data that derive from the project to advocate for in country improvements in the food supply, as well as contributing to the wider global effort to control the harms caused by the consumption of unhealthy processed foods.



### Real-time Food Intake Classification and Energy Expenditure Estimation on a Mobile Device, Daniele Rav`ı, Benny Lo, Guang-Zhong Yang

- Goal

In this paper, we propose a real-time food recognition platform combined with daily activity and energy expenditure estimation.

- Conclusions

In this paper, we proposed an integrated framework for real-time food recognition by exploiting a hierarchy of visual features extracted from the smart phone. The proposed software environment is further integrated with daily activity recognition, allowing combined assessment of food intake and energy expenditure estimation by using a single app. 

The proposed approach has been compared to the state-of-the art algorithms, demonstrating improved accuracy and ease of usability. Future work will be devoted to the measurement of the rate of food consumption and the incorporation of reinforcement learning for online adaptation of the classification algorithm for user-specific training and performance enhancement.




### Face Recognition on Android Smartphones, Antonia Rana, Andrea Ciardulli

In this paper we describe the preliminary results of our experience in using an Android smartphone as a tool which can be used to verify the identity of individuals through the use of two functionalities provided by the most recent generations of smartphones: NFC and face recognition.

The scenario that we used for our tests was that of an emergency situation in which identities can be verified by comparing a picture stored in an id card with a picture taken on the spot.




### Participatory Research with Older Adults with AMD: Co-Designing a SMART Diet Diary App, Lilit Hakobyan, et al.

We report here on a case study in order to outline the practicalities and highlight the benefits of participatory research for the design of sympathetic technology for (and importantly with) older adults with impairments.

We hope our case study has demonstrated how appropriate engagement with the user community can overcome challenges involved in engaging older adults with impairments in research projects and, consequently, yield invaluable results. 

The tangible results (i.e., our proof-of-concept application and elicitation of a comprehensive set of requirements) of our commitment to and wholehearted engagement in participatory research is clear evidence of the significant positive impact of directly involving target users in the design process, despite the perceived difficulty of so doing based on their (dis)abilities. 

The majority of our design findings would certainly not have been uncovered without the direct involvement of target users.

### Developing a smartphone app for m-government in agriculture, Sotiris Karetsos, et al.

The aim of the paper is primarily to review the smartphone use and capabilities in agriculture. An overview of apps targeted to the agricultural business sector is provided.

Secondly, the potential use of smartphones for mobile government is discussed and a transactional mobile government app for the Android operating system is proposed based on a case study for agriculture. The mobile government app is based on a previously developed electronic government system for farmers. 

The use of smartphones for m-government services is still in its infancy. Few m-government apps exist, especially of the interactive and transformational type, but they are constantly evolving.

In this work we propose a transactional m-government app for agriculture as an add-on to an existing e-government portal. The proposed app is easy to use and the user is able to find information and submit requests and applications in a convenient and simple process. They are also able to be up-to-date about the administrative information and processes of their requests. With the use of such apps, farmers could save time and money since they don’t need to travel in order to submit applications and documents by physical presence. 

On the other hand public agencies and local government related to agriculture can lower their administrative burdens and improve their accessibility, effectiveness and efficiency.

### A Crowdsourcing Approach to Promote Safe Walking for Visually Impaired People, Chi-Yi Lin, Shih-Wen Huang, and Hui-Huang Hsu

Many researchers have devoted to promoting safe walking for visually impaired people by using smartphones and computer vision. 

In this research we propose an alternative approach to achieve the same goal – we take advantage of the power of crowdsourcing with machine learning. Specifically, by using smartphones carried by a vast amount of visually normal people, we can collect the tri-axial accelerometer data along with the corresponding GPS coordinates in large geographic areas. 

Then, machine learning techniques are used to analyze the data, turning them into a special topographic map in which the regions of outdoor stairways are marked. With the map installed in the smartphones carried by the visually impaired people, the Android App we developed can monitor their current outdoor locations and then enable an acoustic alert when they are getting close to the stairways.
